Eyes open.  Green orbs embedded with a black cross made of tension.  The air hangs still, breathless, captivated by the sudden awareness.  The cross shifts imperceptibly to a figure eight, and the world perceived by those green orbs shifts along with it.  All things straight become connected, all dangling ends merge with one another and let the unfrozen dark suchre flow through those veins of black.  

A shift of the head sends all the features of the world cascading in a coordinated dance, tumble over one another like playful beads of gel.  A sudden depth clarifies the chaos, identifies the various strokes and contours as a coherent tapestry of distances.  An endless variety of greens untangle themselves from each other, become distinct and unique and embedded in a larger pattern of unhidden relationship.  All at once, the green orbs snap into focus and send a charge of reality radially outward, a nova propagating tangibility at the speed of light.  The wake of that eruption is an invisible growing sphere emitting to the very corners of perceptible existence.  

The figure eights become circles, then three parallel lines of equal length.  The caterpillar is awake.  

"I know you" says the world to the caterpillar.  A tremor wave travels down its green length, uniting the components of its body with messages of awareness.  The leaves sway and flutter as a calm breeze gives life to their flatness.  

"You are only leaves" says the caterpillar to the world, not yet aware of the great emptiness of the sky above it.  "I somehow know your tastiness, though I have yet to taste you".  The world is suddenly a terrifyingly tasty place.  

The world only smiles.  It does not correct the caterpillar.  Yet.  It gazes upon the caterpillar with a patience and benevolence it cannot resist.  In its sublime creations it finds a spark and satisfaction of the unpredictability of volition.  

The caterpillar ripples its host of appendages, incoherently at first, then with coordination.  It lurches forward, tearing itself out of its cradle of immobility, leaving flaps of space dangling behind it.  Fireworks of pleasure innervate the pathways that join its otherwise disparate limbs.  They forge their first agreement to communicate, to let each others intentions flow unhindered so that the fire of motion may nourish their gelatinous membrane.  The feedback between the rippling dance of limbs gains momentum, fuses into a macro engine of focused advance until the entire bulk of the great form of caterpillar is hurtling slowly across the ridged tesselation of the branch underneath.  

Before it, leaf.  Succulent leaf.  The leaf engulfs the caterpillar before it even realizes it has arrived, the sudden embrace overwhelming in its transcendent fullness.  Its mouth wide open, the juicy fibers resist then burst, dribbling green fluid down its incising teeth and vibrating jaw.  Munch munch munch.  The caterpillar cannot even breath its fulfillment is so great.  The three parallel lines melt into spirals, and its jaws continue to oscillate long after the leaf has been reduced to so much mulch.  The caterpillar's arms encircle the surprise of the empty stem, which was certain just a moment ago of its purpose, which continues fruitlessly to nourish a leaf that no longer exists.  The slumber of the caterpillar slips into completion, and the green orbs melt back into sealing.  

The world gazes at the contentment of the caterpillar with a kind of wistful bemusement.  It too knows the acute satisfaction of a single leaf, while simultaneously beholding all leaves in their uniqueness and inseparability.  An inseparability they share with the now slumbering caterpillar.
