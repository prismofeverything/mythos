"We think in dreams..." he announced. "Everything is a dream."

Indeed, the world flowed about him in a riot of color and grace. Streaks of amber and crimson and cobalt ribbons through the sky. He flung his arm out and three buildings sprung into existence, following the arc of his motion. He laughed, and raised his arms to the sky, basalt erupting from the landscape. "I think existence!" he cried. 

A cascade of colored beads flowed out of his creations, taking shape as they approached. Each held a dear companion, smiling with their chosen number of heads. The hair from each a fountain of light and color rising from their painfully exquisite features. Anguish and beauty mingled in every aspect of the world around them. 

Falling like rain, companions arrived to the feast, each a ripple of texture from above. "We love!" they cried. "We fulfill," they whispered.

Partaking of a myriad wonders, the packets of delicacy dissolved on their tongues. One delight after another burst in transcendent gustation. A dazzling kaleidoscope of flavors spiralled outward, covering the world in savory color. "Ahhhhhhh" they gushed. "Ahhhhhh.... !" And all around them rose and fell cities and architectures and broiling structure to suit the course. The world remade itself over and over, an ever renewing and ever delighting cosmos of symmetry. 

"Delightful" she murmurred as she reached over and held the goblet of glowing chartreuse aloft. Rays of dazzling light issued forth, and covered the world in ecstasy.
