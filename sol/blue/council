The council was unraveling. 

Amidst the shouting and gesturing, one form was still. She looked calmly out of her black eyes, impenetrable to the flickering, the chaos around her like the buzzing of flies against the bark of an ancient tree. She didn't look at anything in particular, but she saw everything.

"We have to flee!"

"Where do we gooooo?"

"Underground?"

"Build a ship!"

"A bunker...."

"Doooooomed!!"

The havoc was accelerating. Dozens of stones colliding, splitting and spinning off faster than before. No one heard anything, much less their own words spattering out in a senseless babble. Their bleating spilled out onto the floor, every surface awash in pain and fear.

She let it continue for a moment, then rose. Some gasped and froze, others failed to take notice. But even these faltered, noticing a shift. Soon, all eyes were on her. The anticipation was a solid brick, suffocating them.

Then, from their eyes came the smallest trickle. It started as a drop, then opened into a stream. Deep red ichor flowed down their faces, the pressure in their veins finally released, the relief forming deep valleys down the flesh of their cheeks, until they all tumbled, choking with spasm. Limbs rose into the air like the twisted trunks of desert brush.

She looked past this scene with a serene indifference. Each step she took towards the door effortlessly navigated the mangled masses of her once companions. 

"I will take only the strong" she breathed, and stepped through the portal.
