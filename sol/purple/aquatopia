The currents are swift, the coral entwining itself with the passage of many ponderous unknowable beasts. Towering kelp beds sway and pull, pulsing with empurpled viscosity. The dim light seeps outward, generating energy and compounding fields of luminescence quickly dissolved by the currents. 

In the vastness swim a pod of forms. Above and below melt into a blur of paths, vectors swirling into unknowable depths. The flowing of these bands of motion merge and diverge, passing into synonymity then separation. Threads of their passage converge and then flow outward in every direction. Straight becomes arcing, meandering a form of directness. And everywhere the crushing pressure converted into graceful flux.

A great dome emerges from these dark depths, revealing a scintillation of smaller structures. The motion outlines pathways of greater communication, a language where each being is a word. Each entity in motion a message streaming towards the ear of its great city. Each word launching out into the fathomless abyss, enlightening its surroundings with purpose. These meanings collide, then dance, then spiral into the distance, changed and changing in the neverending stream of expression. 

And the dome grows with a ripeness of eons, the slow and imponderable enrichment of lifetimes of nurturing awareness rising unhurriedly to fullness. A distinct budding bubble, home to countless existences, separates and drifts outward. Catching a current it swirls into the unknown, streaming behind it a trail of communication, becoming part of the network of consciousness populating the aqueous nether.
