The world sees with eyes from every viewpoint. Every gesture, every motion, impressions of itself upon itself. Every flowering plant, cascading over itself, a waterfall of foliage. The lightness of laughter, itself flowering like a plant. Laughter riding the waterslides of foliage down to the warm pools below. Collecting in eddies and currents and fusing with the water into a fabric of mirth.

A hand reaches over to grasp a leaf of nectar. A thousand hands, a thousand leaves. The graceful extension of the mind, raising to merge with a smirking curve. The infusion of nectar, flowing like a warm current. A thousand warm currents, a thousand savorings. A thousand eyes opening in the cradle of awareness. Every eye seeing every other, a blanket of perception perceiving itself. 

A million gasps, a million tiny bubbles bursting, a million million seeping tears of honey. A million tiny mouths opening at once. In recline, the curves of awareness merge as the thousand limbs superimpose and become one. A tunnel of distinctions fusing in geometric union. A thousand glints of self, totality.

A breeze, a helix of warmth, entwining the world in a fabric of sensation. Everyone lifting their green leaves to the sky and drinking the sun. Warmth as packets of life, the air thick with life, nourishing every limb. Every limb moving independently, a tapestry of motion, a great dance of synchronized identity. Limbs within limbs, digits like tiny arms, arms like trees of digits. And the smiles a liquid melting into harmony. A planet of smiles. 

Every eye seeing every other. Eyes within eyes within eyes, an endless well of mirroring beauty. Eyes like honey, honey like eyes.
